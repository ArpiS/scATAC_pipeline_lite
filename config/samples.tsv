# This file specifies the samples in the dataset		
# 'Sample': the name of the sample		
# 'Lane': a list of names indicating the different sequencing lanes in a sample		
#    The input FASTQs will be concatenated in this order		
# 'Path': a path template for an input fastq		
#    This path is relative to `input_dir` in config.yaml		
#    {lane} is expanded by the names enumerated in the Lanes column		
#    {read} is expanded by the `read_names` in config.yaml
